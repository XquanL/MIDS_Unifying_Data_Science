We can infer that the educational attainment of women in the survey data is higher than that of men. This is because in Exercise 8, the coefficient on female is larger in magnitude where education is controlled than it was in Exercise 6, which suggests that controlling for education has increased the unexplained wage gap between men and women, and meaning that female education attainment is higher than men so they have smaller wage gap when education is not controlled."

    "The fact that adding education as a control variable changed the coefficient on female suggests that the educational attainment of men and women in the survey data differed significantly. This means that before adding education as a control, the potential outcomes of men and women in terms of their earnings could have been confounded by differences in their educational attainment. That is, the potential outcomes of men and women before controlling education is not the accurate causal estimate of gender discrimination as education can caus omitted variable bias(OVB). The change in the coefficient on female after controlling for education indicates that the effect of gender on earnings was partially driven by differences in education levels between men and women. By controlling education, we can also infer that factors other than education level, such as discrimination or differences in work experience, may be contributing to the gender earnings gap."

By doing this, we can effectively focus on the wage gap within each industry rather than the overall wage gap across all workers. This can generate a more precise estimate of the gender wage gap within each industry.\n",

    "The estimate of gender wage gap becomes -10,860 when the industry fixed effects are added. The choice of industries by men and women can have a significant impact on the gender wage gap. Given the decreasing gap of wage between men and women, we can infer that women are more likely to work in low-paying industries. In general, adding fixed effects for industry or job type can provide a more nuanced understanding of the gender wage gap by controlling for the impact of different industries on men and women's wages."
